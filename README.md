# Hi there! 👋

I'm **Fabian**. I love solving business problems with technical solutions.

I'm married to Alies, a dedicated, freelance trainer who specializes in leadership and professional communication training for individuals and business teams. We have a 2-year old son, Raaf: a very active, strong willed and happy boy.

## 🚀 Professional Background

I'm a **senior technology leader** with:
- **25 years** of development experience
- **15+ years** building scalable applications  
- **7+ years** leading an international development team

Recognized as the *"go-to person for complicated code challenges that other team members can't fix."*

Most recently at **Reptune**, I transformed technology from startup-phase to enterprise-grade, solving critical stability issues while achieving **top-3 global market position**.

## 🎯 My Approach

My approach focuses on **removing bottlenecks and dependencies** for sustainable growth—both in code architecture and team dynamics—ensuring operations run smoothly even as complexity increases.

> My belief is that the main driver for productivity is **happiness**. Happiness is driven by autonomy, trust and psychological safety, and the developer experience (dx).
