## About Me

I'm a senior technology leader with 25 years of development experience, 15+ years building scalable applications and 7+ years leading an international development team. Recognized as the "go-to person for complicated code challenges that other team members can't fix."

Most recently at Reptune, transformed technology from startup-phase to enterprise-grade, solving critical stability issues while achieving top-3 global market position.

My approach focuses on removing bottlenecks and dependencies for sustainable growth—both in code architecture and team dynamics—ensuring operations run smoothly even as complexity increases.
