Hi,

I’m Fabian. I love solving business problems with technical solutions.
I'm married to Alies, a dedicated, freelance trainer who specializes in leadership and professional communication training for individuals and business teams. We have a 2-year old son, Raaf: a very active, strong willed and happy boy.


I'm a senior technology leader with 25 years of development experience, 15+ years building scalable applications and 7+ years leading an international development team. Recognized as the "go-to person for complicated code challenges that other team members can't fix."
Most recently at Reptune, transformed technology from startup-phase to enterprise-grade, solving critical stability issues while achieving top-3 global market position 
My approach focuses on removing bottlenecks and dependencies for sustainable growth—both in code architecture and team dynamics—ensuring operations run smoothly even as complexity increases.

My belief is that the main driver for productivity is happiness. Happiness is driven by autonomy, trust and psychological safety, and the developer experience (dx). 

I'm seeking Technology leadership roles (CTO, Head of Development, Fractional CTO) or Senior C# Developer positions where complex problems need pragmatic solutions. Open to both permanent positions and fractional engagements (2-4 days/week).
Ideal Focus Areas: Start-ups, FinTech, RegTech, Enterprise SaaS, Scale-ups needing technical transformation, AI.
Location Preference: Amsterdam, Weesp, Naarden, Almere, Bussum, Hilversum and surrounding areas (public transport-accessible).
