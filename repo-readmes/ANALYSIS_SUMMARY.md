## How to Use This Skill

```bash
# Analyze a specific README
node .claude/skills/readme-analyzer/readme-analyzer.js path/to/README.md

# Get just the score
node .claude/skills/readme-analyzer/readme-analyzer.js --score

# Verbose output with all sections
node .claude/skills/readme-analyzer/readme-analyzer.js --verbose
```

## Common Missing Sections

Based on initial analysis:
- **Prerequisites** - Often missing, should be added before Installation
- **Changelog** - Important for tracking changes
- **Configuration** - How to customize/setup the project
- **Authors/Maintainers** - Who maintains this project
- **Diagrams** - Architecture diagrams, flowcharts, and data models help users understand the system

## Diagram Standards

**✅ REQUIRED FORMAT:** All diagrams MUST be created using **Mermaid** syntax.

**Why Mermaid?**
- Text-based (version control friendly)
- Renders natively on GitHub, GitLab, and many markdown editors
- No external tools or image files needed
- Easy to update and maintain
- Supports: flowcharts, sequence diagrams, entity-relationship diagrams, gantt charts, and more

**Mermaid Examples:**

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A[Start] --> B{Is it working?}
    B -->|Yes| C[Great!]
    B -->|No| D[Debug]
    D --> B
```

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    User->>API: Request
    API->>Database: Query
    Database-->>API: Results
    API-->>User: Response
```

**❌ AVOID:**
- Image files (PNG, JPG) - not version-control friendly
- External diagramming tools (draw.io, lucidchart) - creates external dependencies
- ASCII art - hard to read and maintain

**✅ GOOD PRACTICE:**
- Include Mermaid diagrams directly in README.md
- Keep diagrams simple and focused
- Add brief descriptions before each diagram
- Use consistent styling across all diagrams

## Recommendations

1. **High Priority**: Add missing Essential sections
2. **Medium Priority**: Add at least 3 Important sections
3. **Low Priority**: Enhance with Nice-to-Have sections
