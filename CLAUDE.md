# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Primary Goal

This repository serves as **Fabian's public GitHub profile** - a portfolio piece aimed at recruiters, HR managers, and tech leads.

The README.md should:
- Showcase **multiple repositories** and their capabilities
- Demonstrate **skills and tech stack** as a senior developer (25 years experience)
- Highlight **leadership experience** (CTO, Head of Development, Fractional CTO roles)
- Appeal to **freelance clients** and potential employers
- Focus on **business value** and problem-solving capabilities, not just technical features

**When modifying README.md**: Always consider the audience - they're evaluating Fabian for hiring decisions. The content should demonstrate:
- Technical breadth and depth
- Real-world impact and achievements
- Leadership and architecture skills
- Business acumen (solving real problems, not just writing code)

## Repository Structure

## Git Activity Dashboard

The **git-activity-dashboard** tool has been moved to its own repository:
- **Repository**: https://github.com/fabiantax/git-activity-dashboard
- **Purpose**: High-performance Rust CLI for analyzing git contributions and generating LinkedIn-ready visualizations

When working with git activity analytics, refer to that repository instead.

## Claude Code Skills

Project-specific skills in `.claude/skills/`:

- `/motion-canvas` - Create animated videos with Motion Canvas (TypeScript)
- `/readme-analyzer` - README quality analysis and improvement suggestions

## Video Generation

For creating animated videos from git activity data, see the **git-activity-dashboard** repository which includes:
- **Motion Canvas** - TypeScript animations with math
- **Remotion** - React-based video generation
- **canvas2video** - Direct JSON to MP4 conversion

The parent repository has the `/motion-canvas` skill for general video creation tasks.

## Repository Context

This is Fabian's primary GitHub profile repository. When making changes:
- **README.md**: This is the public profile homepage. Edit with care - recruiters and tech leads see this. Focus on showcasing capabilities, not just technical docs.
- **CLAUDE.md**: This file provides guidance for AI assistants working on portfolio updates
- **repo-readmes/**: Contains summaries of other projects for reference

### Keeping README.md Updated

The profile README should be refreshed periodically to:
1. Highlight recent projects and achievements
2. Showcase diverse tech stack (Rust, C#, TypeScript, Python, etc.)
3. Demonstrate breadth: frontend, backend, DevOps, architecture, leadership
4. Include activity badges/widgets generated by git-activity-dashboard
5. Update "About Me" section to reflect current goals and availability

### Featured Projects

When adding or updating project descriptions in README.md:
- Focus on **business value** and problem-solving capabilities
- Mention **tech stack** and technical approach
- Highlight **impact** and results achieved
- Include **links** to live demos or repositories when available
- Keep descriptions concise but informative (2-3 sentences per project)

### Portfolio Maintenance

Regular updates to maintain an active and engaging profile:
- **Weekly/Monthly**: Update with recent activity or completed projects
- **Quarterly**: Review and refresh all sections
- **Yearly**: Complete portfolio refresh with new achievements

Use tools from the **git-activity-dashboard** repository to generate:
- Activity summaries for LinkedIn
- Portfolio reports
- Video visualizations of git activity
- README badges and widgets
