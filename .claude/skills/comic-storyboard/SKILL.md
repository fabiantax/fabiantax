# Comic Storyboard Generator

Transform README features or project descriptions into engaging 4-part comic storyboards for marketing, presentations, or visual content creation.

## What It Does

Creates a structured 4-panel comic storyboard with:
- **Emotional arc** (Problem → Discovery → Solution → Result)
- **Scene descriptions** for each panel
- **Character actions and expressions**
- **Visual elements and metaphors**
- **Text/captions for each panel**
- **Color palette recommendations**
- **Freepik/visual creation guidelines**

## When to Use

- Creating marketing materials for your project
- Building visual presentations or pitch decks
- Designing social media content
- Creating user journey comics
- Explaining complex products through storytelling

## Story Structure

All storyboards follow this proven 4-part structure:

### Part 1: The Problem (Pain Points)
- Show user struggling with current situation
- Emotional state: frustrated, exhausted, confused
- Visual metaphor: battery low, blocked path, heavy burden
- Establish empathy with the audience

### Part 2: The Discovery (Aha Moment)
- Character discovers the solution/insight
- Emotional state: surprised, enlightened, hopeful
- Visual style: lightbulb moment, glow effect
- Pattern recognition or realization

### Part 3: The Prevention/Solution (Taking Action)
- Character using the solution confidently
- Emotional state: hopeful, empowered, in control
- Visual metaphor: shield, guidance system, clear path
- Specific feature benefits highlighted

### Part 4: The Result (Transformation)
- Character enjoying success/outcome
- Emotional state: joyful, confident, connected
- Visual proof: before/after comparison, stats
- Social proof: friends, colleagues benefiting

## Best Practices

### Character Development
- Give your protagonist a name and relatable context
- Show, don't tell (use visuals to express emotions)
- Create emotional stakes (missing important moments, letting people down)

### Meaningful Activities
**✅ GOOD:**
- Meet with friends (social connection)
- Play with son/family (relationships)
- Go hiking (personal goals)
- Attend important events (milestones)

**❌ AVOID:**
- Grocery shopping (too mundane)
- Doing laundry (low emotional impact)
- Routine tasks (not memorable)

### Visual Style Guidelines
- **Panel 1:** Muted colors (blues, grays) - convey struggle
- **Panel 2:** Transition colors - discovery phase
- **Panel 3:** Warm colors (greens, yellows) - hope, safety
- **Panel 4:** Vibrant colors - joy, success

### Text Guidelines
- Keep panel text to 1-2 sentences
- Use dialogue bubbles for character speech
- Use captions for context/narration
- Include emotional hooks in captions

## Color Psychology

| Color | Emotion | When to Use |
|-------|---------|-------------|
| Blue | Sadness, exhaustion | Problem panels |
| Gray | Confusion, stagnation | Before solution |
| Green | Safety, growth | Solution/action |
| Yellow | Hope, optimism | Discovery phase |
| Orange/Red | Warning, urgency | Risk indicators |
| Vibrant mix | Joy, vitality | Success/result |

## Output Format

The skill generates:

1. **4 Panel Descriptions** - Detailed scene setup, characters, actions
2. **Visual Elements List** - Key items to include in each panel
3. **Text/Captions** - Exact text for dialogue and captions
4. **Color Palette** - Recommended colors per panel
5. **Freepik Guidelines** - Assets, styles, composition tips

## Example: Health Tech Product

**Panel 1:** Mom cancelling on friends again (isolation)
**Panel 2:** Discovers pattern in her health data (insight)
**Panel 3:** Confidently says "yes" to playing with son (action)
**Panel 4:** Hiking with friends, 0 cancellations (transformation)

## Tips for Freepik Creation

1. **Search keywords:** Use emotions + contexts (e.g., "exhausted mom working," "happy friends hiking")
2. **Consistent style:** Use same illustration style across all 4 panels
3. **Character consistency:** Same character appearance in each panel
4. **Simple backgrounds:** Don't clutter, focus on characters and key props
5. **Text legibility:** Use large, readable fonts for panel text
